This stack will use express for its backend, and react In JS not TS. Make sure to use `` for all code writen, unless you can't. As well as always use tabs, never spaces. Make sure all code is readable, does not include redundant comments, only insightfull yet condense ones that serve a purpose of reminding people who know the codebase. VERY IMPORTANT: Make sure when you can write code that is not for the person to understand, but for cleanness, optimization and scalability. Finally make sure to never make long nests, try and use !condition when you can to avoid this.
